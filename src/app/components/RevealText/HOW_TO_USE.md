# Reveal Text

Text reveals line-by-line as it scrolls into view. Each line is masked and slides up into place with a staggered timing, creating a premium reading experience.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This component uses **GSAP ScrollTrigger**. You must import and register it at the top of your component file (see Step 3 below).

---

## Quick Start (Recommended)

The fastest way to add this component to your project:

```bash
npx tweenlabs@latest add RevealText
```

This automatically installs the component and all its dependencies. You're done!

## Manual Installation (Step-by-Step)

If you prefer to install manually, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Install GSAP

Open your terminal in your project folder and run:

```bash
npm install gsap @gsap/react
```

> [!TIP]
> Using pnpm? Run `pnpm add gsap @gsap/react` instead.
> Using yarn? Run `yarn add gsap @gsap/react` instead.

### Step 2: Copy the Component Code

1. Click the **"Full Component Code"** tab in the code viewer above
2. Click the **"Copy"** button in the top-right corner
3. In your project, create a new file: `src/components/tweenlabs/RevealText.tsx`
4. Paste the copied code into that file
5. Save the file

### Step 3: Import and Use It

Open the page where you want to use this component and add:

```tsx
"use client";

import RevealText from "@/components/tweenlabs/RevealText";

export default function MyPage() {
  return (
    <main>
      <RevealText />
    </main>
  );
}
```

### Step 4: Register GSAP Plugins

Make sure the top of your component file has these imports:

```tsx
import gsap from "gsap";
import { useGSAP } from "@gsap/react";
import { ScrollTrigger } from "gsap/ScrollTrigger";

gsap.registerPlugin(useGSAP, ScrollTrigger);
```

## How the Animation Works

This section shows the core GSAP animation logic. You don't need to copy this separately — it's already included in the Full Component Code above. This is here to help you understand how it works.

### Core GSAP Animation Code
```javascript
const blocks = gsap.utils.toArray(".reveal-block");

blocks.forEach((block) => {
  const split = SplitText.create(block, {
    type: "lines",
    linesClass: "reveal-line",
    mask: "lines",
  });

  gsap.from(split.lines, {
    y: "100%",
    opacity: 0,
    duration: 0.8,
    ease: "power3.out",
    stagger: 0.12,
    scrollTrigger: {
      trigger: block,
      start: "top 80%",
      end: "bottom 60%",
      toggleActions: "play none none reverse",
    },
  });
});
```

## Customization

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
|------|------|---------|-------------|
| `text` | `string` | Required | The paragraph text to reveal. |
| `stagger` | `number` | 0.1 | Delay between each line reveal in seconds. |

### Theme Tokens

This component uses TweenLabs' Neo-Brutalist design tokens:

| Token | Value | What It Does |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| Background | `bg-[#f0eadf]` | Warm sand-colored canvas |
| Borders | `border-3 border-[#2a2a2a]` | Bold charcoal outlines |
| Shadows | `shadow-[6px_6px_0px_#2a2a2a]` | Tactile offset drop shadows |

> [!TIP]
> You can change these values throughout the component to match your own design system. Just search and replace the hex colors.

## Troubleshooting

**Animation not playing?**
- Make sure you have `"use client"` at the very top of your component file
- Check that GSAP is installed: `npm list gsap`

**Component not rendering?**
- Verify the import path matches your file location
- Make sure you're using React 18+ or 19

**ScrollTrigger not working?**
- Make sure you imported and registered ScrollTrigger (see Step 4)
- Check that your component has enough scroll height (the page must be scrollable)
- Try adding `ScrollTrigger.refresh()` after dynamic content loads

**Styling looks wrong?**
- This component uses Tailwind CSS utility classes
- Make sure Tailwind is installed and configured in your project
